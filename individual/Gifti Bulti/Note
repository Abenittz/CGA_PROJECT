Lesson 1: Programming for a Purpose

Overview
In this lesson, we explore how to design animations and games tailored to user needs.

Question of the Day
How can we design animations and games based on the needs of a user?

Key Concepts
1.Understanding the User:
    Identify the target audience and their needs (entertainment, education, etc.).
2.Purpose of the Animation/Game:
      Educational: Teach concepts.
      Entertainment: Provide fun experiences.
      Therapeutic: Support mental health or rehabilitation.
3.User-Centric Design:
       Incorporate user feedback.
       Ensure accessibility.
       Allow customization of experiences.
4.Prototyping and Testing:
       Use rapid prototyping.
       Conduct user testing to refine designs.
5.Iterative Design Process:
       Follow the cycle: Design → Prototype → Test → Refine.
Activities
1.Identify a User Group: Choose a target audience and discuss their needs.
2.Brainstorm Game Ideas: Generate concepts for games or animations tailored to your audience.
3.Mock-up Design: Create a simple design mock-up of your game or animation.
4.Present Your Ideas: Share your concept and explain how it meets user needs.




Lesson 2: Plotting Shapes

Overview
In this lesson, we will learn how to effectively communicate the process of drawing shapes on a screen using programming concepts.

Question of the Day
How can we clearly communicate how to draw something on a screen?

Explanation
To communicate drawing instructions clearly, we can:

1.Use Simple Commands: Break down the drawing process into clear, concise steps (e.g., "move to (x, y)", "draw a line to (x2, y2)").
2.Visual Representation: Provide visual examples alongside instructions to illustrate what the final shape should look like.
3.Coordinate System: Explain the coordinate system (e.g., x and y axes) to help users understand where to plot points.
4.Interactive Feedback: Implement interactive tools that allow  users to see immediate results as they follow the instructions.
5.Consistent Terminology: Use consistent language and terminology throughout the instructions to avoid confusion.


Lesson 3: Drawing in Game Lab
Overview
In this lesson, we will learn how to communicate with a computer to draw shapes on the screen using Game Lab. We will focus on positioning shapes and understanding the concepts of sequencing and debugging.

Question of the Day
How can we communicate to a computer how to draw shapes on the screen?

Explanation
To draw shapes on the screen, we use specific commands that tell the computer what to do. For example:

    ellipse(x, y, w, h): Draws an ellipse at the coordinates (x, y) with a width w and height h.
    fill(color): Sets the fill color for shapes that will be drawn afterward.
    rect(x, y, w, h): Draws a rectangle at the coordinates (x, y) with a width w and height h.
Vocabulary
1.Bug: A part of a program that does not work correctly.
2.Debugging: The process of finding and fixing problems in an algorithm or program.
3.Program: An algorithm that has been coded into something that can be run by a machine.
